# Chao engineering

	Chaos Monkey - A resiliency tool that helps applications tolerate random instance failures.

	The Simian Army - A suite of tools for keeping your cloud operating in top form.

	orchestrator - MySQL replication topology management and HA.

	kube-monkey - An implementation of Netflix's Chaos Monkey for Kubernetes clusters.

	Gremlin Inc. - Failure as a Service.

	Pumba - Chaos testing and network emulation for Docker containers (and clusters).

	Chaos Toolkit - A chaos engineering toolkit to help you build confidence in your software system.

	ChaoSlingr - Introducing Security Chaos Engineering. ChaoSlingr focuses primarily on the experimentation on AWS Infrastructure to proactively instrument system security failure through experimentation.

	PowerfulSeal - Adds chaos to your Kubernetes clusters, so that you can detect problems in your systems as early as possible. It kills targeted pods and takes VMs up and down.

	drax - DC/OS Resilience Automated Xenodiagnosis tool. It helps to test DC/OS deployments by applying a Chaos Monkey-inspired, proactive and invasive testing approach.

	Wiremock - API mocking (Service Virtualization) which enables modeling real world faults and delays

	MockLab - API mocking (Service Virtualization) as a service which enables modeling real world faults and delays.

	Pod-Reaper - A rules based pod killing container. Pod-Reaper was designed to kill pods that meet specific conditions that can be used for Chaos testing in Kubernetes.

	Muxy - A chaos testing tool for simulating a real-world distributed system failures.

	Toxiproxy - A TCP proxy to simulate network and system conditions for chaos and resiliency testing.

	Blockade - Docker-based utility for testing network failures and partitions in distributed applications.

	chaos-lambda - Randomly terminate ASG instances during business hours.

	Namazu - Programmable fuzzy scheduler for testing distributed systems.

	Chaos Monkey for Spring Boot - Injects latencies, exceptions, and terminations into Spring Boot applications

	Byte-Monkey - Bytecode-level fault injection for the JVM. It works by instrumenting application code on the fly to deliberately introduce faults like exceptions and latency.

	GomJabbar - ChaosMonkey for your private cloud
