# master data management

  ```
    In business, master data management (MDM) is a method used to define and 
  manage the critical data of an organization to provide, with data integration, 
  a single point of reference.[1] The data that is mastered may include reference
  data- the set of permissible values, and the analytical data that supports 
  decision making.
