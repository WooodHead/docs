## API Maturity Model

Success in the digital world isn't just about enabling access through Application Programming Interfaces (aka APIs, a set of commands, functions and protocols which programmers use when building software for specific operating systems).
It also requires an “industrialized” model to deliver and evolve differentiated APIs at the speed and scale needed to capture new opportunities.
Industrialization refers to a set of technologies for publishing APIs with the efficiency, agility and scale needed to compete in today’s digital world.
Part of the our API Management Suite, our Maturity Model describes this journey against a number of necessary dimensions, including:

* Strategy and Governance
* Architecture
* Development Process
* Developer Community
* Optimization
