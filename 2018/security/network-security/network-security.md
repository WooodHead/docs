# Network Security


```
To provide enterprises with superior DDoS protection, Kona Site Defender includes:

  Network-Layer Controls: by defining and enforcing IP whitelists and blacklists, 
you can allow or restrict requests from specific geographical regions and certain IP addresses.
  Application-Layer Controls: pre-defined, configurable application-layer firewall 
rules let you address categories such as protocol violations, request limit violations, 
HTTP policy violations and more.
  Adaptive Rate Controls: by monitoring and controlling the rate of requests against
applications, you can automatically protect them against application-layer DDoS 
and other volumetric attacks.
  Kona Rules: using WAF rules developed and updated by Akamai's Threat Intelligence Team, 
you can continually address new and emerging web application attacks.
  Security Monitor: get real-time visibility into security events and drill down 
  into attack alerts.
Site Shield: cloak your origin from the public Internet to protect against 
direct-to-origin attacks.
 Logging: integrate WAF event logs into security information and event management
to increased threat posture awareness.```
