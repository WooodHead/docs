# IAM - Identity and Access Management Overview
  
# IAM Definition

  - James A. Martin

    ```
      Identity and access management (IAM) in enterprise IT is about defining and managing the roles
    and access privileges of individual network users and the circumstances in which users are granted
    (or denied) those privileges. Those users might be customers (customer identity management) or
    employees (employee identity management. The core objective of IAM systems is one digital identity
    per individual. Once that digital identity has been established, it must be maintained, modified 
    and monitored throughout each user’s “access lifecycle.”
      IAM systems provide administrattors with the tools and technologies to change a user's role,track
    user activies, create reports on those activities, and enforce policies on an ongoing basis. These
    systems are designed to provide a means of administering user access across an entire enterprise 
    and to ensure compliance with corporate policies and government regulations.

     grant access to the right enterprise assets to the right users in the right context, from a user’s
    system onboarding to permission authorizations to the offboarding of that user as needed in a timely 
    fashion

# IAM Capabilities Model
 
  - [API Security]
   
    ```
     API security enables IAM for use with B2B commerce, integration with the cloud, and microservices-based 
    IAM architectures. Forrester sees API security solutions being used for single sign-on (SSO) between
    mobile applications or user-managed access. This would allow security teams to manage IoT device
    authorization and personally identifiable data.
