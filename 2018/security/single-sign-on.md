    ```
      Single sign-on(SSO) is centralized session and user authentication service
    in which one set of login credentials can be used to access multiple applicaitons
    Its beauty is in its simplicity; the service authenticates you one on one
    designated platform, enabling you to then a plethora of services without
    having to log in and out each time.
    ```
