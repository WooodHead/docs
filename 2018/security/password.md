      A properly designed password manager is an excellent first step in securing
    your online identity. It generates a unique strong passwrod for every account
    and applicaiton, without requiring you to memorize or write down these random
    strings of charactors. These strong passwords help shield against tranditional
    password attacks such as dictionary, rainbow tables or brute-force attacks.

      Two-factor authentication increases security by asking a user to provide
    not only their password, but also more proof that they are who they say they
    are. There are lots of forms of two-factor authentication, such as a code
    texted to a phone, a code generated from an app or a fingerprint.
