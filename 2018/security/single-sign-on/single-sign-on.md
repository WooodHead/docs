# Single Sign-On Overview

# Single Sign-On Capability Model

  - [Doug Drinkwater](https://www.csoonline.com/author/Doug-Drinkwater )
  
    ```
      Single sign-on(SSO) is centralized session and user authentication service
    in which one set of login credentials can be used to access multiple applicaitons
    Its beauty is in its simplicity; the service authenticates you one on one
    designated platform, enabling you to then a plethora of services without
    having to log in and out each time.

    ```
# Capability Model
 
  - Barry Scott, CTO at Centrify EMEA

   ```
     The first is that it improves the user experience by stopping the sprawl of
   different usernames and passwords which came about through the incredible rise
   in SaaS cloud-based applications.
     The second reason is improved security. The main cause of breaches is 
   compromised credentials and the more usernames and passwords we have, the worse
   our password hygiene becomes. We start to use the same passwords everywhere
   and they often becom less complex, making it easier for credentials to be
   compromiesed.
