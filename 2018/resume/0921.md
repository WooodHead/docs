# 0919

  - download source code from ttps://github.com/apache/fineract-cn-identity, then to build it
  - report issues
  - Without official detailed installation deployment documentations about Fineract-CN 
  - considerable number of jar dependencies are not downloadable from https://jcenter.bintray.com, I have to built it one by one

  - read official documents and answer the questions
  ```
    1) Is it pure Microservices architecture?
    Some like, e.g. It uses Eureka as service registry and discovery, but it doesn't mention distributed monitoring and dependency tracing.
    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/Composing+a+Release+out+of+Microservices
    2) Is there an API Gateway like APIGee we can use?
    No ,there is no life cycle management of apis like APIGee
    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/REST+API+Live+Documentation+Using+Swagger
    3) Are the APIs well documented and how many APIs are available?
    It supplies but simple, I'm not sure how many they are until I stats it.
    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/Apache+Fineract+CN+API+Documentation
    4) How is security handled in the system?
    It uses configuable two-Factor authentication.
    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=67641984
    The stateless authentication is performed via JWT bearer tokens which need to be regularly refreshed. The tokens are signed via a tenant-specific private key and long-lived tokens are transmitted as secure cookies, thus limiting the possibilities for interception
    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=73634331
    5) How is data protected? Any database level settings for security?
    Not sure until I check the code.
    6) Does it integrate with external systems (like SWIFT etc.) or is it easy to build the integrations ourselves?
    It supplies the Share Account Management & Dividends Payment
    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=66852875
    7) How well is the source code documented and do they following coding standards etc.?
    No, It's no or seldom documented within the source code.
    8) How easy is it for a team in Bamboo to take up this source code and maintain it/ add new functionality/ etc.?
    I'm not sure how easy because there are some features or strategies are in-progress and some are outstanding.
    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/In-Progress+Features
    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/Outstanding+Features
    9) How does the system scale? Is it purely on cloud? Can it run in AWS with auto scaling?
    Presently Fineract CN is in the process being deployed on a Virtual Machine. they have the plan to containerized it now.
    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/Design+architecture+of+Containerized+FineractCN
    10) Any performance bottlenecks you can evaluate in the source code or architecture?
    Itâ€™s maybe, how does it design multiple tenants to scale out, how does it cache history query,.
    11) Deploy the mobile application and see if it works on both android + iOS.
    Android is supported but iOS is not mentioned
