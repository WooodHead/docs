12.Quality controls and system availability assurance. 

Risks
The following risks were identified in COFISWEBC:
Non-availability of required hardware will have impact on the performance and stability of the system
Multiple application databases hosted on the same hardware and sharing the storage could have impact on batch/online performance.
Database back-ups/ Cache Refresh operations coinciding with batch/online process may degrade performance.
Due to the fact that softaware gmbh is not liable to the calculation engine kernel the overall performance goals of 400ms per request with an average load of ~ 150 requests/second and a maximum load of ~350 requests/second could be threatened since performance measurements stated that 75% to 90% of the overall calculation time is spent in the calculation engine kernel.
Miscalculations compared to the DFE version due to insufficient definition of the needed engine input (activation) parameters. Support from BMW and Infosys will be required.
Miscalculations compared to the DFE version due to insufficient maintenance of the COFISWEBC database.
Dependency on UCP SF release windows.
