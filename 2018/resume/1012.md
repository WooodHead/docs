#1010

  - fineract-cn login issue 
  
    ```
      I found the way to jump the “npm run build ” issue and deployed frontend component to nginx server.
    But now, It’s failed to login using the tenant(playground),username(operator) and password (init1@l) 
    that is provided by How To Build Apache Fineract CN . You may see login page . 
    I think we would spent more time to checkout the more source codes to my local computer solve this problem.  
    ```
