  ```
    1. Are the APIs well documented and how many APIs are available?
    About APIs well documented
    My past answer is : It supplies but simple, I'm not sure how many they are until I stats it.
    My current answer is :Yes, It supplies the details with website 
    http://smartfinance.tech/fineract-cn-api-docs
    About how many APIs are available
    Up to now, There are 149 apis , the attachment is detail.

    2. How is data protected? Any database level settings for security?
    Data Isolation :Data is placed in separate databases for each tenant 
    Data Tier Design Consideration:
    rdbms : to create user based views, internal validation, reporting, or analytics
    nosql: for fast processing of state changes and financial transactions.
    message queue: for signals to parties which are interested in the change of data 
    Data Access Authentication and Authorization:
    JWT is used to stateless authentication 
    public and private key used to sign tokens
    fixed salt used for server-side password hashing
    how long a user's password is valid between password changes.
    how long the user's grace period is to change a password after it has expired.
    Request Update and Query Isolation - Command and Query Responsibility 
    Data Driven Authorization 
    Data Driven Authorization enforces the user to have specific role before being able 
    Private Data Protected 
    For database level settings for security
    It only supplies user/password to authenticate with jdbc connection, When I find new content, I will report it to you in time.
