Customer can only shoot directly from Physical PRC ID but can not choose the picture from album. (Dee’s Suggestion)

Story ID: EP007-S004-DW:
If the applicant passes face recognition, then the applicant authorizes BMW to check your PBOC personal credit record for application purpose.
If the user clicks “Start Face Recognition”, Face Recognition Services will be triggered and start shooting one face image of the applicant, then compare the image with the photo collected from ID card. (It might change if we can use New Interface from NCIIC.) 
If the comparison score passes the “threshold value” set previously, then Vivo Detection will be triggered to verify the applicant is alive. If the Vivo Detection passes, then the Whole Face Recognition succeed, another front-end page will appear:”congratulations, …” (to be continued in next user story EP007-S004-DW.)

In the back-end, eAPP should judge whether the ID is Expired or Valid with the recognized valid period information. If the ID is expired, eAPP front end page will show message to the user “Sorry, your ID card has expired, please use an valid card to do identity authentication and continue your journey.” 
If the ID is valid, eAPP front end will show the recognized “Authority” and “Valid Period”, and all the data will be saved. The user Now can continue to upload Bank Card and continue the application.
